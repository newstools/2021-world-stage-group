The Managing Director/Chief Executive Office of ADF, Zouera Youssoufou stated that the Board of the Foundation has already approved the next phase of disbursement of the grants across Ogun, Osun, Kwara, Edo, Rivers, Anambra, Ebonyi and Bauchi states. She described the Aliko Dangote Foundation Micro-grant programme as a N10 billion programme designed to provide a N10,000 one-off grant to at least 1,000 vulnerable women, and in some cases, youths, in each of the 774 LGAs across Nigeria. She said that the programme is being implemented in partnership with State governments who work with committees set up down the ward levels to ensure the appropriate beneficiaries are reached. Youssoufou said the scheme provides recipients with a one-time, un-conditional N10,000.00 cash grant to meet immediate household consumption and economic needs. “As far as possible, participants also receive training tailored to bolster their income-generating activities which are critical for the welfare of millions of Nigerians. Beneficiaries of this programme are evenly selected from the target communities with primary consideration for vulnerable women, food distressed household with infant or children under-five year old, disabled, divorcees, widows with multiple dependents, and extremely poor residents in these communities”, she said. It would be recalled that the Programme is implemented in partnership with State Governments to complement their economic empowerment and poverty reduction drive,.  The Executive Governor of each state is tasked with setting  up a committee to oversee the implementation of the programme alongside Aliko Dangote Foundation staff. Since 2016, the Foundation automated the beneficiary enrolment and payment processes. In addition to the cash grants, beneficiaries were also given mobile phones and SIM cards by the Foundation. In the last two states, the scheme was implemented, the Foundation partnered with a leading commercial bank to open bank accounts and provide ATM card for each beneficiary.
