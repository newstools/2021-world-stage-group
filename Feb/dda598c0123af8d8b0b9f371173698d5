WorldStage Newsonline– 11 Plc, formerly Mobil Oil on Friday clarified some issues raised on its delisting from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), saying the exercise was not a forceful acquisition of shares from minority shareholders. Shareholders of the company had approved the delisting at their Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 14 October, 2020 during when the share was selling for N186.90 at the NSE. However, a delisting price of N213.90 was arrived at, being the highest price traded six months preceding the notice of the AGM at which the resolution to delist was considered and approved. In the clarification at the NSE signed by Chris-Olumayowa Meseko, Company Secretary, 11 PLC said the delisting price was therefore not arbitrarily arrived at. It said the mandatory tender offer (MTO) by NIPCO Plc of minority shareholders’ interest at the share price of N417.12 (same price at which it acquired ExxonMobil’s 60% interest in the issued share capital of the company in 2017), followed due process (after receiving requisite regulatory approvals ) and was in strict conformity with extant laws. The planned delisting, the company said would not make company private, but only cessation of trading shares on the NSE. It said the company’s shares will be listed on the NASD OTC, thus still making them tradable. On the observation that the share price of the company has currently appreciated above the N213.90  delisting price, the company said shareholders have a choice of selling their shares now at the price indicated by the company or at the NSE platform price before the delisting cutoff date, or to sell on the NASD platform after delisting, or to hold on to their shares and continue to receive their dividend. It raised hope that the company could choose to return to the NSE platform sometime in the future while assuring the minority shareholders that they have nothing to fear or worry about in connection with delisting.
