Former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has expressed shock over the death of former Information Minister, Chief Tony Momoh. He described the late Momoh as a statesman, patriot and exemplary journalist. In a condolence message on Monday night by his Media Office, Asiwaju Tinubu said: “I’m deeply saddened by the passing of Chief Tony Momoh. “I recall reading his interview in one of the national newspapers a few days ago where he restated his love of this country and his belief in its future. “He was a statesman and patriot resolutely committed to the unity and progressive development of this country. Exemplary journalist, he earned domestic and global recognition as Editor of the old Daily Times in those challenging days for journalists. “He was not just a journalist, he was also a notable politician. He was one of the true founders of the APC. A close associate of President Muhammadu Buhari, Chief Momoh as Chairman of the CPC worked day and night to bring about the historic merger with the ACN and other parties that led to the APC. “His death is a great loss at this time his wise counsel is needed in the country. My condolences to his family. I pray that God give them the strength to overcome this loss. I commiserate with the Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria, the Guild of Editors and indeed with the Media Confraternity. “I also mourn with the government and people of Edo State and the entire country. May the soul of Chief Momoh rest in perfect peace in the bosom of the Lord.” Senate President
