U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday that the U.S. will meet its obligations to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Consequently, Blinken said the U.S. would pay more than $200 million by the end of the month to the global health body. “This is a key step forward in fulfilling our financial obligations as a WHO member. “Also, it reflects our renewed commitment to ensuring the WHO has the support it needs to lead the global response to the pandemic,’’ Blinken said at a UN Security Council meeting. U.S. President Joe Biden halted his country’s withdrawal from the WHO within hours of his inauguration in January. The exit had been set in motion by Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump, last year and would have become official in July. A U.S. exit from the WHO would have meant the loss of the Geneva-based agency’s biggest financial contributor. Washington has been providing between $400 million and $500 million annually to the WHO budget of nearly $3 billion. The U.S. also recently announced it would join the United Nation’s Covax programme to share COVID-19 vaccines fairly between richer and poorer countries.
