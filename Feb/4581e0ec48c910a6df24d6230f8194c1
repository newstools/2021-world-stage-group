The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has again cautioned the public against patronising and depositing monies in wonder banks. The corporation gave the warning on its official twitter handle in Abuja on Thursday. According to the NDIC, the banks offer juicy returns in weeks but leave you in regrets for years. The corporation advised the public to deposit money only in banks accredited by it.
