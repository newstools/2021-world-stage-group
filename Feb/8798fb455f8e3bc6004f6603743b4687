U.S. President Joe Biden approved an executive order to enable the U.S. to sanction members of Myanmar’s military for their involvement in a recent coup. Biden announced this on Wednesday. “Today, I’ve approved a new executive order enabling us to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests, as well as close family members,” Biden said. The U.S. will identify a first round of targets this week, and will also impose export controls on the country and freeze U.S. assets that benefit the government of Myanmar. “Today, I again call on the Burmese military to immediately release the democratic political leaders and activists they are now detaining,” Biden said.
