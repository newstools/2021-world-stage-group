This is with the aim of eliminating 60 metric tonnes of plastic yearly, Nestlé Nigeria Plc, makers of Nestle MILO, said in a statement on Monday.

The newly developed paper straws are 100 per cent biodegradable as well as safe and easy to use. Consumers can purchase the new packs starting this February. Speaking on the paper straws for MILO Ready-To-Drink (RTD), Mr Wassim Elhusseini, the MD/CEO for Nestlé Nigeria, said: “We are proud to take this leading action to protect the environment. “Transforming how we make, use, reuse and recycle our packaging plays an important role in the bold commitments we have made to reduce packaging waste and mitigate climate change.” “This is proof that Nestlé and other companies can be a force for good in society by providing products that are good for people and good for the planet,” Wassim reaffirmed. Also, Olutayo Olatunji, Category Manager, Beverages, Nigeria.
