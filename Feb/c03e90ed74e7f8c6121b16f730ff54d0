Zambia’s Information and Communication Technology (ICT) regulator on Friday said it had given a local firm a license to commence mobile phone services. The Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA) said the license was awarded to Beeline Telecoms Limited, becoming the country’s fourth mobile phone service operator. Patrick Mutimushi, the regulator’s director-general said the award of the license followed an analysis of the market which revealed deficiencies in the quality of services by the current operators and the need to stiffen competition. In 2018, the regulator awarded UZI Zambia, a unit of Unitel International Holdings B.V, registered in the Netherlands a license to commence operations but it was revoked in 2020 after failure to start operations. Currently, Zambia has three mobile phone service operators namely: Airtel Zambia, MTN Zambia and Zamtel.
