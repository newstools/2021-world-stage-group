WorldStage Newsonline– Ellah Lakes Plc, a Nigerian agribusiness that is currently specializing in Oil Palm & Cassava cultivation in Edo & Delta States said three major shareholders – CBO Capital Partners, Blackman & Co and Osaro Oyegun have had undertaken to each sell down 25% of their shares to resolve the lack of liquidity in the shares of the company on or before 15th March 2021. Ellah Lakes in a notification at the Nigerian Stock Exchange said the decision was taken following discussions with the NSE on the lack of liquidity in the shares of Ellah Lakes Plc due to the company’s free float that currently stands at 14.55% with a value of N1,236,333,070.75. The NSE’s regulations require all companies listed on the Exchange’s Main Board  must have a minimum of 20% of their shares held by members of the public or free float value of N20 billion. Ellah Lakes said majority of its shares were consolidated and free float was reduced to 13% following the completion of the acquisition of Telluria in 2019. Mr Chuka Mordi, the CEO of Ellah was quoted as saying, “We fully appreciate why we need to have more shares of Ellah Lakes in the hands of the public, which is why we are listed on the NSE. “We are working towards compliance, and we fully expect that we can achieve this by the deadline of 15 March 2021, so as to galvanise, and encourage liquidity in the shares of Ellah Lakes Plc.”
