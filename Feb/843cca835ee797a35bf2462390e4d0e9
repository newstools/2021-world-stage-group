The United States (U.S.) will seek election to return as a member of the Human Rights Council, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday. The announcement is coming after nearly three years of U.S’. absence from the top UN rights body. Blinken participated as an observer in an online session of the Geneva-based council. Washington left the group under the administration of former president Donald Trump. “The U.S. is placing democracy and human rights at the centre of our foreign policy because they are essential for peace and stability. “We humbly ask for the support of all UN member states in a bid to return to a seat in this body,” Blinken said. The chief diplomat acknowledged that his country is facing its own challenges regarding democracy and rights. “People of colour in the U.S. deal every day with the consequences of systemic racism and economic injustice,” Blinken added. He added, however, that the U.S. is openly dealing with such problems, in contrast with authoritarian regimes. Blinken pledged that Washington will continue to call out violations in countries such as China, Myanmar, Russia, and Venezuela. He made clear that President Joe Biden’s administration shares concerns about the Human Rights Council that the Trump administration had voiced as it left the body. The council should stop singling out Israel, and its members should not include “those with the worst human rights records,” Blinken said.
