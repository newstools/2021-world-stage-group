Ford Motor Co. (F) said that the global semiconductor shortage, combined with parts shortages created by the central U.S. winter storm in February. It said this was prompting the company to build F-150 trucks and Edge SUVs in North America without certain parts, including some electronic modules that contain scarce semiconductors. The company said it would build and hold the vehicles for a number of weeks, then ship the vehicles to dealers once the modules were available and comprehensive quality checks. Ford said it would cancel the night shift on Thursday and both shifts on Friday at Louisville Assembly Plant due to a semiconductor-related part shortage. The company expects its Escape and Lincoln Corsair production to resume Monday on short shifts, with full production scheduled to resume on Tuesday. In addition, the company was taking further down days at Cologne plant, suspending Fiesta production March 1-16, as well as March 22. Ford said that if the semiconductor shortage scenario was extended through the first half of 2021, the shortage could adversely impact the companyâ€™s adjusted EBIT by between 1.0 billion and 2.5 billion dollars and some production make-up in the second half of the year.
