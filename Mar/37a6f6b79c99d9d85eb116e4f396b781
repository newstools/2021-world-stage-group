WorldStage Newsonline– Nigeria’s Mobile Network Operators (MNOs ) and Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) have resolved the protracted disagreements concerning the appropriate Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) pricing model for financial transactions with resolution that USSD services for financial transactions conducted at DMBs and all Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)- licensed institutions will be charged at a flat fee of N6.98 per transaction effective March 16, 2021. In a joint statement by the CBN and the Nigerian Communications (NCC) on Tuesday, the resolution was arrived at a meeting chaired by the Minister of Communications and Digital economy on March 15, 2021 where key stakeholders  including various MNOs, Association of Licensed Telecoms Operators of Nigeria (ALTON), Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON), banks’ chairman, body of bank CEO and sector regulators-CBN and NCC were represented. The joint statement signed by Osita Nwanisobi, Ag Director, Corporate Communications, CBN and Dr Ikechukwu Adinde, Director, Public Affairs, NCC said the new charges replaces the current per session billing structure, ensuring a much cheaper average cost for customers to enhance financial inclusion. “This is transparent and will ensure the amount remains the same, regardless of the number of sessions per transaction,” the statement said. To promote transparency in its administration, it said the new USSD charges will be collected on behalf of MNOs directly from customers’ bank accounts and banks shall not  impose additional charges on customers for use of the USSD channels. It said the settlement plan for outstanding payments incurred for USSD services, previously rendered by the MNOs, is being worked out by all parties in a bid to ensure that the matter is fully resolved. With the agreement, the statement said the impeding suspension of DMBs from USSD channel “is hereby vacated. Therefore the DMBs shall no longer be disconnected from the USSD channel.”
