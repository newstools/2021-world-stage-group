Shell Egypt and one of its affiliates have signed an agreement with a consortium made up of subsidiaries of Cheiron Petroleum Corporation and Cairn Energy PLC to acquire Shell’s upstream assets in Egypt’s Western Desert for a base consideration of US$646 million and additional payments of up to $280 million between 2021 and 2024, contingent on the oil price and the results of further exploration. The transaction is subject to government and regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in the second half of 2021. The package of assets consists of Shell Egypt’s interest in 13 onshore concessions and the company’s share in Badr El-Din Petroleum Company (BAPETCO). “Today’s announcement is consistent with Shell’s efforts to shift our Upstream portfolio to one that is more focused, resilient and competitive” said Wael Sawan, Shell’s Upstream Director. “The deal will deliver value to Shell and to Egypt. It will enable Shell to concentrate on its offshore exploration and integrated value chain in Egypt, including seven new blocks in the Nile Delta, West Mediterranean and Red Sea. It will help Egypt maximize the potential of its onshore assets through new investment, helping secure energy and revenue for years to come.”
