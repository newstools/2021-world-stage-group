U.S. President Joe Biden called the four-day visit to Iraq by Pope Francis a symbol of hope for the entire world. Biden said in a statement that the trip, which ended on Monday, “sent an important message’’ about brotherhood and peace. “To see Pope Francis visit ancient religious sites, including the biblical birthplace of Abraham, spend time with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in Najaf, and offer prayers in Mosul; “Mosul a city that only a few years ago endured the depravity and intolerance of a group like ISIS and it is a symbol of hope for the entire world,’’ Biden said. The president said he continues to admire Pope Francis for his commitment to promoting religious tolerance, the common bonds of our humanity and interfaith understanding. Biden also offered his congratulations to the government of Iraq for helping pull off this monumental visit amid the pandemic and security concerns.
