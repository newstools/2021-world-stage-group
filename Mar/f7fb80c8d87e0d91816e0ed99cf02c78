According to the mission, Jan Kubis, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Libya, and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), welcomed the swearing-in of the new government in a statement late on Monday. “The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Libya, and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), Jan Kubis, welcomes the swearing-in of the Government of National Unity (GNU) today before the House of Representatives (HoR), during its session in Tobruk,” the mission said. Kubis urged the new executive authority to swiftly embark on addressing the many challenges facing the Libyan people. The envoy also urged the new executive authority to enhance the living conditions and basic services as well as prepare the country for the holding of inclusive national elections later this year. The mission confirmed that it, along with its international partners, would stand firmly ready to continue providing all necessary support to the Libyan people and Libyan institutions. The new executive authority, which consists of the Presidency Council and the Government of National Unity, took the oath during an official session of the House of Representatives in the eastern city of Tobruk. The UN-sponsored Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) recently selected a new executive authority for the country, which was welcomed by all the Libyan parties. Moahmmed Menfi was appointed as the President of the Presidency Council along with the new Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, whose Government was granted confidence by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The new Government’s main task is to hold general elections in the country on Dec. 24, 2021, as agreed by the LPDF.
