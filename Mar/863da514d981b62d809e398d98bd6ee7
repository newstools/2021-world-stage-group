Alphabet Inc’s Google will invest $7 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. this year, down from the $10 billion last year, and create 10,000 new full-time jobs as it takes on a pandemic-driven surge in internet traffic. The latest investment includes expansion plans for data centres in Nebraska, South Carolina and Texas, and its offices in Atlanta, D.C., Washington, Chicago and New York. Google is also spending $1 billion in its home state of California. The move comes at a time when many companies are exiting Silicon Valley after the pandemic triggered a broader shift to remote work, making companies reconsider the state’s higher operational costs and hefty taxes.
