Prince Harry said a large part of the reason he and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, left England for a life in the United States was racism in Britain. In new footage aired on Monday from the interview on U.S. television network CBS, Oprah Winfrey asked if the couple left because of racism, the prince replied: “It was a large part of it.’’ He added that he was urged by an unnamed person at a fundraiser for his charity Sentebale to not do this with the media as they will destroy your life. The prince said he was told “You need to understand that the UK is very bigoted,’’ to which he replied “The UK is not bigoted, the UK press is bigoted, specifically the tabloids.’’ Harry added, “But unfortunately if the source of info is inherently corrupt or racist or biased then that filters out to the rest of society.’’
