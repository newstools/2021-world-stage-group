Iran remains ready for exchanging all the prisoners with the U.S., the Iranian government’s spokesman said on Tuesday. “We are ready to exchange all inmates. Such a thing has not happened so far because the U.S. was not prepared,” Ali Rabiei said in a weekly news briefing, Tasnim news agency reported. He said Iran was waiting to see “how serious” the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is in reconsidering the policies of the previous administration. The policies include “delays in the release of all Iranian prisoners detained on unacceptable charges under U.S. orders in various countries.” The spokesman stressed that Iran’s position had not changed, reiterating the fact that Washington withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and was violating UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2231. “Whenever the U.S. decides to fulfill its legal obligations under the UNSC resolution and lift the sanctions, we will fulfill all our commitments quickly,” Rabiei said. Rabiei added Iran welcomes “any diplomatic initiative” that can accelerate that process. Asked about the situation of Iran’s blocked assets, Rabiei said the U.S. government had reduced “brutal pressures” on other countries to freeze Iran’s funds, but “these measures are insufficient.”
