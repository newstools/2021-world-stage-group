WorldStage Newsonline– Nigerian Bottling Company Limited, the major bottler of CocaCola in Nigeria has reacted to the legal case between it and Rite Foods Limited regarding the Predator Energy drink, saying neither NBC nor its Managing Director, is in breach of any court order. NBC in a statement said the company and Predator Energy would like to make it clear that, “firstly, we are well within our rights to continue to sell the Predator products and secondly, neither NBC nor its Managing Director, is in breach of any court order. “Naturally, we will contest the case vigorously and after due consideration of the merits of the case we are confident that the Court will confirm our rights based mainly on the facts that the bottles and logos are not confusingly similar and Predator Energy’s established use of the Predator brand and logo in many other markets around the world.”
