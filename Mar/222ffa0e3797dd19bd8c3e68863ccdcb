WorldStage Newsonline– The National Metrology Institute (NMI) of the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has taken delivery of additional weight standards to boost the ongoing calibration of various weighbridges in use in the country. A statement from the office of the Director General, SON, Mallam Farouk Salim disclosed that the investment was in line with its determination to ensure equity in business and control rapid wear and tear on Nigerian roads. According to him the increased capacity was in furtherance of implementing the Federal Government’s directive to ensure that all axle load weighbridges are properly monitored and maintained throughout the country by SON. The Government through the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and its Transportation counterpart recently directed SON to commence calibration of all axle load weighbridges in Nigeria as part of measures to protect the roads from excessive loads by cargo trucks and trailers. The NMI had since commenced the activity with the calibration of axle weighbridges at the APM Terminal, Apapa Ports in Lagos. Director of the NMI, Engr. Bede Obayi stated that the increased capacity of the NMI was in fulfilment of the promise by Mallam Farouk Salim on his maiden visit to the Institute.  According to him, NMI as Nigeria’s custodian of primary reference standards for the calibration of all measurement instruments and equipment, represents the Country at the international Bureau for Weights and Measures (BIPM) conferences and conventions in order to be in tune with international best practices.
