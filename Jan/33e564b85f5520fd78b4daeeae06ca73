WorldStage Newsonline– Brown House, the major stakeholders in Finima community has disowned a group calling itself ‘the Finima Renaissance’ which issued a press release with the title ‘NLNG has failed Finima people’. The press release was signed by one Samuel Brown as the convener of the unknown group. However, the Buoye Omuso (Brown) Major House in a counter statement on January 18, 2021 signed by Wari-Alabo Inima Dickson Brown, Ag Chairman, Council of Wari-Alapu and Wari-Alabo Airigha Goni-Brown, Secretary, Council of War-Alapu affirmed that they did not know or have any organization going by the name of the Finima Renaissance. They also denied authorizing neither the unknown Samuel Brown nor the faceless group to issue a press release on their behalf or on behalf of Finima community. As the leaders of Buoye Omuso (Brown) Major House of Finima and Finima community, they therefore advised the general public to discountenance the press release. They said the general public should “be wary of impostors and faceless groups who may want to create disaffection between NLNG and Finima in order to attract advantages to themselves.” Going forward, they advised the general public to verify information that purports to emanate from their community for purpose of clarification. “We assure the nation of our resolve and firm commitment to maintain the cordial relationship existing between Finima and NLNG and possible improve on it for our mutual benefit,” they said.
