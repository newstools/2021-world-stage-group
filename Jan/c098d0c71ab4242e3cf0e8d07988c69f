The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is expected to approve Boeingâ€™s crisis-ridden 737 Max jet. This will enable it to return to the skies in the coming days. The approval was expected next week after changes made to the plane model fulfilled flight safety conditions, EASA Chief, Patrick Ky, said in an online press meeting on Tuesday. The 737 Max has already been approved again in the United States and Brazil. The fleet of medium-haul jets was grounded in March 2019, after two 737 Max crashes due to faulty steering software in which a total of 346 people died.
