According to Onyeama, the relationship between both countries has dated 50 years, adding that both countries have many areas of cooperation to celebrate. “We also realised that in 2021, we would be celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations between Nigeria and the Peoples Republic of China,” he said.

He said that they also discussed health issues and the global pandemic. “In the area of fostering relations, both countries are now considering having a direct flight from Nigeria to China. “We want to establish direct air link with China. We hope that very soon, a Nigerian carrier would be carrying out scheduled flights to China in the not too distant future,” he said.
