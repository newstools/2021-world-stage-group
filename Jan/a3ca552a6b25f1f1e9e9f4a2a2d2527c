A blimp depicting U.S. President Donald Trump as a baby which hovered in London during his state visit to the capital is to be conserved at a museum. The Museum of London in central london, confirmed it had acquired the blimp and may display it to the public in the future. “While we’re pleased that the Trump Baby can now be consigned to history along with the man himself, we’re under no illusions that this is the end of the story,’’ the team who made the balloon said in a statement. “We hope the baby’s place in the museum will stand as a reminder of when London stood against Trump – but will prompt those who see it to examine how they can continue the fight against the politics of hate.’’ Museum of London Director Sharon Ament said “by collecting the baby blimp we can mark the wave of feeling that washed over the city that day and capture a particular moment of resistance that ultimately shows Londoners banding together in the face of extreme adversity.” The blimp, created by Imagine Inflatables in Leicestershire, depicts Trump shouting, wearing a diaper and holding a mobile phone. It was flown over Parliament Square during a protest in 2018, which was held in response to the president’s three-day state visit in 2019. Several high-ranking politicians rejected an invitation to a banquet dinner with the president at the time, including former opposition and Leader of the Labour party Jeremy Corbyn. The museum’s obtainment comes two days before Trump leaves office as the 45th president.
